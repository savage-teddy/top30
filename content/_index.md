<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">The Bible Has Been Changed Throughout History</h1> 

### Problems
1. Define what you mean by “Changed.” Languages change over time to adapt to culture and the meanings remain the same. If a message changes grammatically, the content can still be preserved. If something is changed doctrinally, it isn’t the same message you started with. This kind of change simply can’t be found in the Old or New Testament and we have written evidence to confirm this.
2. What is your standard for reliable transmission of a message? If your standards throw out all of history as a result, you’re not being reasonable. You’re being a radical skeptic. If no evidence will convince you, you’re not looking for truth. You’re ignoring it.
3. “The Bible was written by humans. Humans make mistakes. Therefore the Bible is full of mistakes.” is a self-defeating statement. “That statement was written by humans. Humans make mistakes. Therefore, that statement is full of mistakes.” You are assuming too much before looking at the evidence. If you believe there are mistakes, point to them specifically. Don’t just make up a clever saying that ends up destroying itself when you think about it for more than 3 seconds.  

### Facts
1. We have more written evidence to support the New Testament than any other document in ancient history. (Over 1000 years old) The earliest complete copies, the Codex Vaticanus and Sinaiticus are Greek copies of the New Testament that are both dated to the 300’s AD. The closest any ancient writing in history comes as close to the original as the New Testament is Homer’s Illiad, which we found a copy of 500 years after the original was written.
2. The earliest physical evidence of the Bible’s existence is the John Ryland Fragment P52. It is a piece of The Gospel of John including several verses from chapter 18 and is dated to within 20 years of the original. Within the lifetimes of those who had seen the original and its author. 
3. There are two ways to test if something has been changed over time. Compare the earliest copies to the latest and compare the differences, or Compare all the copies you have and see where and when changes took place over time. The earliest copy of the New Testament is the Vaticanus and it’s identical to what we’re reading today. The total number of New Testament manuscripts we have available to us to compare to the others number over 26,000 the last time we counted. We have more ability to test changes in the Bible than any other written piece of information in ancient history. 
Sources/Evidence: John Ryland Fragment P52, The Codex Vaticanus (300AD), The Codex Sinaiticus (450AD), The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ by Dr. Gary Habermas, Christian Apologetics by Norm Geisler, A Ready Defense by Josh McDowell, 
Verses: 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 2 Peter 1:16, Isaiah 40:8

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">The Bible Contradicts Itself</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. A Difference between two details is not a contradiction. 
2. An addition to detail is not a contradiction.
3. A scribal error is not a contradiction.
4. Misrepresenting the text and comparing it to another piece is not a contradiction.
5. Reading a passage out of context and comparing it to another is not a contradiction.

### Facts: 
1. A Contradiction is where two things in the same way and in the same sense cancel each other out. The First Law of Logic is the law of Non-Contradiction. Two things that cancel each other out can’t both be true in the same way and in the same sense.
2. Context is the who, what, when, where, why, and how of a statement. There are 3 kinds of Contexts you’ll run into when you read anything; Immediate Context - What happened after and leading up to what was said. 

Historical Context - When, where, and to whom something was said.
Extended Literary Context - What kind of book and what kind of person wrote the statement.

### Examples: 
1. Did the Samaritans receive Jesus or not?
John 4:39-40: Yes - Luke 9:52-53: No
Answer: Read Luke again. This was towards the end of His ministry. John was at the beginning. People’s opinions change over time. That’s not a contradiction. It’s a different time in the same place. 
2. Does the Bible say to honor parents or to dishonor them?
Luke 9:59-62: Don't honor parents (Let the dead bury their own dead). - Exodus 20:12: Honor Parents
Answer: The saying, “Let me bury my father” doesn’t mean his dad died. He was saying that he’ll follow Jesus after his dad dies at some point in the distant future. Not understanding a cultural phrase isn’t a contradiction.
3. Did Herod think Jesus was John the Baptist? 
Matthew 14:1-2/Mark 6:16: Yes - Luke 9:9: No.
Answer: Herod can be wrong about things. He and many others thought that Jesus was John risen from the dead. That wasn’t true. They simply recorded his opinion. All three accounts including Luke’s mention that this is what people thought. Read verses 7-8. Matthew doesn’t mention Herod’s opinion and doesn’t conflict in any way with Luke. Mark summarizes the exact same statements in Luke and Matthew. And Herod in no way denies he thought Jesus could be John. He only says that he beheaded John. If Herod believed John had risen as Matthew and Mark report, then he just acknowledges the first key detail in rising. That he was dead. A difference in phrasing is not a contradiction. 
4. Can Anyone cast out demons or only followers of Jesus?
Mark 16:17: Only Jesus' Followers - Matthew 7:21-23/Mark 9:38/Luke 9:49: People who weren't following Jesus
Answer: The passage in Mark answers your question. The people who didn’t follow Jesus still believed in Him. They simply weren’t among the group known as His disciples. (followers) All of the miracles they performed they did in Jesus’ name. Misinterpreting a passage isn’t a contradiction.
5. Are people who aren't with Jesus against Him?
Luke 11:23: Those who are not with Jesus are against Him - Luke 9:50: Those who are not against Jesus are with Him.
Answer: Two different chapters, two different audiences. Those in chapter 11 were the Pharisees who tried explaining away the miracles Jesus performed as the works of Satan. Enemies. Those in chapter 9 were people performing miracles in Jesus’ name and believing in Him even though they weren’t a part of the group known as the disciples. Not Enemies. Ignoring Context isn’t a Contradiction.
6. Was Jairus' daughter dead or alive when he asked Jesus to heal her?
Luke 8:41-42: She was still alive and died along the way. - Matthew 9:18: She was dead and Jairus asked Jesus to raise her.
Answer: Matthew and Luke are two different people noting the same event. The only differences are the additions to detail Luke provides. Matthew remembers Jairus’ daughter died and asked Jesus to raise her. Luke includes the detail that she was sick and asked Jesus to heal her, then when a messenger told him she had died, he asked Jesus to raise her. (Where Matthew’s account starts) An additional detail isn’t a contradiction. 
7. What was Sodom's sin?
Luke 10:10-12: Inhospitality? - Jude 1:7/Genesis 19:1-5: Sexual immorality? - Jeremiah 23:14: Adultery and Lies?
Answer: Where do any of these exclude the others? Are Sexually Immoral people always Hospitable? Are liars and adulterers always hospitable and sexually moral? Additional details aren’t contradictions.
8. Was Jesus born in a manger or a house?
Luke 2:1-7: A manger - Matthew 2:11: A house
Answer: Matthew 2 took place at least 2 years after Jesus’ birth. Plenty of time for Joseph to find Mary and Jesus a roof over their heads. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.
9. Was Mary blessed?
Luke 1:26-28: Yes. - Luke 11:27-28: No.
Answer: Luke 11 in no way discredits the fact that giving birth to the Messiah is an honor. Jesus didn’t deny her being blessed for that reason in any way. He simply took the time to take a woman’s attention off of His biological mother and back onto the word of God. Ignoring context is not a contradiction. 
10. How many demon possessed men were there outside of Gadarine county?
Luke 8:26-27/Mark 5:1-2: One man - Matthew 8:28: Two men
Answer: Luke and Mark don’t say one man and only one man. They focus on that man because he did all the talking. Matthew was a tax collector and noticed numbers. He included that detail that in no way discredits the others. Additional details aren’t contradictions.
11. Were the Pharisees baptized by John the Baptist?
Matthew 3:7-11: Yes - Luke 7:29-30: No
Answer: Matthew says they came to be baptized. If you read the passage, you’d find out that John refused to baptize them. Luke is consistent with this. Misreading two passages is not a contradiction
12. Where did the demons ask not to be sent?
Mark 5:9-10: Out of the country. - Luke 8:30-31: To the Abyss.
Answer: Is the Abyss in the country of Judea? It’s not even in this universe. Not knowing what the Abyss is isn’t a contradiction.
13. Does God lead us into temptation or not?
James 1:13-14: No - Matthew 6:13: Yes
Answer: Read Matthew again. You’re assuming God regularly leads you into temptation as opposed to delivering you from the evil one. Reading half a verse isn’t a contradiction.
14. Does God sleep?
Psalm 121:3-4: No - Psalm 44:23: Yes
Answer: Both are Psalms, poems using figurative language to illustrate God’s involvement in Israel, and at another time in history, describing how he felt about God’s lack of involvement. Ignoring what kind of book you’re reading and taking them woodenly is not a contradiction.
15. How did David kill Goliath?
1 Samuel 17:49-50: A sling - 1 Samuel 17:51: Cutting his head off with his own sword.
Answer: You cut a passage in half to ignore the answer to your objection. David knocked Goliath out with a sling, and confirmed his death by cutting off his head. Taking a passage out of context isn’t a contradiction. 
16. Do Christians know how to pray?
Matthew 6:9-13: Yes. - Romans 8:26: No.
Answer: Read Romans again. The phrase is “as we ought.” Jesus showed His disciples how to pray, but where we fall short, the Holy Spirit fills in the gaps. Misrepresenting the passages aren’t contradictions.
17. Was Moses a good speaker?
Acts 7:22: Yes. - Exodus 4:10: No.
Answer: Moses was a good speaker the first 40 years of his life. After killing the Egyptian, he spent 40 years in the wilderness talking to sheep. At 80 years old, it is possible he wasn’t as good a speaker as he was. Ignoring the context of both statements is not a contradiction.
18. Can thieves go to Heaven?
1 Corinthians 6:9-10: No - Mark 15:27/Luke 23:32;43: Yes
Answer: Read verse 11. The thief recognized Jesus as His Savior and was in the same boat as those Paul describes as “were thieves.” Reading half of a passage out of context isn’t a contradiction.  
19. When was Jesus' beaten?
John 19:2-3;16: Before Pilate ordered His crucifixion. - Matthew 27:26/Mark 15:15: After Pilate ordered His crucifixion.
Answer: Do any of those passages say He was beaten only once? Additional details aren’t contradictions.
20. Was Lot Abraham's brother or nephew?
Genesis 14:14-16: Brother. - Genesis 14:12: Nephew.
Answer: The word in Genesis 14:14 is relative. Achiw in Hebrew. Assuming the literal term brother in the modern sense without doing 2 minutes of further study isn’t a contradiction.
21. Was Jonah swallowed by a fish or a whale?
Jonah 1:17: Fish - Matthew 12:40: Whale
Answer: Good grief. Sea creature, Large fish. This isn’t a book of marine biology. It describes what happened. Nit-picking genus terms is not a contradiction. 
22. Where did Joseph and Mary live before Jesus was born?
Luke 2:1-7: Nazareth - Matthew 2:1-11: They lived in Bethlehem and moved to Nazareth after fleeing their home in Egypt.
Answer: Matthew’s account gives additional details. Additional details aren’t contradictions. 
23. Did Joseph and Mary go to Egypt or Nazareth after Jesus was born?
Matthew 2:14: Egypt and then Nazareth. - Luke 2:39: Just to Nazareth
Answer: Both? Egypt first, then Nazareth. Additional details aren’t contradictions.  
24. Was Jesus the Son of David?
Matthew 1:6: Yes. - Matthew 22:45 - No, Jesus apparently denied that.
Answer: Jesus is asking the pharisees a question they don’t want to answer because the answer proves He’s not only David’s son, but God. Ignoring the context is not a contradiction.
25. Who was Jesus' grandfather?
Matthew 1:16: Jacob - Luke 3:23: Heli
Answer: People normally have two sets of grandparents because they have two parents. Luke is Mary’s family history. Matthew is Joseph’s family history. Joseph is noted instead of Mary’s name because the traditional record of family history goes from male to male. Ignoring the context is not a contradiction.
26. Is it a good thing to be childish?
Luke 18:17: Yes - Ephesians 4:14: No
Answer: Jesus is addressing a child’s view of a relationship as simply knowing they’re loved. Paul addresses the idea of being childishly manipulated as a bad thing. Ignoring context is not a contradiction. 
27. Did The Father address Jesus directly?
Mark 1:11: Jesus directly. - Matthew 3:17: Those who attended Jesus' baptism.
Answer: You can address two different people who are in the same place at the same time. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.
28. Would Jesus always be with His disciples?
Matthew 28:20: Yes, until the end of the age. - John 12:8: No, He won't always be with them.
Answer: Jesus wouldn’t be with them physically after He physically died. When He physically leaves the disciples in Matthew, He’ll be with the disciples through the Holy Spirit, which Jesus described in the other 4 chapters of John they didn’t read. Ignoring the context is not a contradiction.
29. When did Satan enter Judas?
Luke 22:3-7: Before the Last Supper - John 13:27: After the Last Supper.
Answer: Read the passages. One says Satan put it into the heart of Judas to betray Him. After the supper, Satan entered Judas to go through with it. Additional details aren’t contradictions.
30. Who put a robe on Jesus? 
Luke 23:11: Herod's Soldiers - Matthew 27:27-28: Pilate's Soldiers
Answer: Both? Herod’s Soldiers put a purple robe on Jesus to mock him. When the Roman soldiers beat Jesus, they put a purple robe on Him. I wonder where they got it? Same robe perhaps? Ignoring context is not a contradiction.
31. What did the Centurion call Jesus on the cross?
Matthew 27:54: Son of God - Luke 23:47: A Righteous Man
Answer: Is the Son of God not right with God? Could he have said both things? Not knowing what righteous means is not a contradiction.
32. Where were the women standing when Jesus was crucified?
Luke 23:49: At a distance. - John 19:25: Near the cross.
Answer: Could they have gotten closer over time? Ignoring context is not a contradiction.
33. What did the sign above Jesus' head say?
Matthew 27:37: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. - Mark 15:26: King of the Jews. - Luke 23:38: This is the King of the Jews. - John 19:19: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.
Answer: Additional words aren’t contradictions. They are all the same thing with words left out but none conflicting with the other. Additional details aren’t contradictions.
34. Who buried Jesus?
Matthew 27:57: Joseph of Arimathaea - John 19:38-42: Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus, - Acts 13:27-29: The Jews and their rulers.
Answer: Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus were Jewish rulers. Additional details aren’t contradictions.
35. What did Jesus ride into Jerusalem on?
Matthew 21:5-7: A Donkey and her colt. - Luke 19:35: A colt. - John 12:14: A young donkey
Answer: They’re all the same thing. A Donkey and her colt were both there.The colt was the animal ridden upon.  One is mentioned in one case and both in the other. Additional details aren’t contradictions.
36. Did both thieves revile Jesus?
Matthew 27:44: Both thieves. - Luke 23:39-42: One thief
Answer: They both reviled him, but one eventually changed his mind. Additional details and ignoring context aren’t contradictions.
37. Did Judas identify Jesus with a kiss or did Jesus identify Himself?
John 18:3-5: Jesus identified Himself. - Matthew 26:47-49: Judas identified Jesus with a kiss.
Answer: Could both have happened to confirm to the guards that it indeed was Jesus? Additional details aren’t contradictions. 
38. Was Jesus taken to Annas or Caiaphas first?
Matthew 26:57: Caiaphas - John 18:13: Annas
Answer: Annas first. Matthew doesn’t say He went to Ciaphas first. Assuming things out of context isn’t a contradiction.
39. When was heaven created?
Matthew 25:34: When the Earth was created. - John 14:2: After Jesus ascended.
Answer: John doesn’t say that is when Heaven was created. He was going to prepare a place for them in Heaven when He ascended. Not create Heaven. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.
40. Was Keturah Abraham's wife or concubine?
Genesis 25:1: Wife - 1 Chronicles 1:32: Concubine
Answer: Keturah was a concubine until Sarah died. She then became his wife. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.
41. Did Sarah have faith that she would conceive?
Hebrews 11:11: Yes - Genesis 18:10-15: No
Answer: Is it laughing to doubt? Even if you assume she doubted at first, the end result is recorded. She did trust God after He directly addresses her and names her child Laughter. She then reiterates God’s promise to her when she gives birth to the child. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.
42. Where does God dwell?
Psalm 9:11: In Zion. - Psalm 123:1: In the Heavens
Answer: What about Psalm 139 where it says God is everywhere? Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.
43. How was Zedekiah related to Nebuchadnezzar?
2 Kings 24:17: His uncle. - 2 Chronicles 36:10: His brother
Answer: The word in 2 Chronicles 36:10 is relative. Achiw in Hebrew. Assuming the literal term brother in the modern sense without doing 2 minutes of further study isn’t a contradiction.
44. Is God warlike or peaceful?
Exodus 15:3: Warrior - Romans 15:33: Peaceful
Answer: The God of Peace isn’t capable of going to war? Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction. 
45. Who were Saul's sons?
1 Samuel 14:49: One list, - 1 Chronicles 8:33: Different list
Answer: The lists are the same. One includes a contemporary nickname and another son that died and didn’t do anything in history. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.
46. Who carried Jesus' cross?
John 19:17: Jesus. - Luke 23:26: Simon of Cyrene
Answer: Both? Jesus carried it part of the way, and Simon was compelled to do it the rest of the way after Jesus’ trauma and bloodloss from the Romans scourging got the best of Him. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.
47. Did Zedekiah's eyes behold the King of Babylon?
Jeremiah 34:3: Yes. - 2 Kings 25:7: No
Answer: 2 Kings 25 and verse 7 says that his eyes were put out and he was taken to Babylon. Verse 6 says he was brought before the king of Babylon who then put his eyes out after seeing him. Ignoring the previous verse isn’t a contradiction.
48. What is God's name?
Exodus 6:2-3: YHVH - Exodus 34:14: Jealous - Exodus 3:14: I AM
Answer: Names carry meaning. In American/modern culture, people only have one name and it means little more than what their parents liked or honoring a relative. When Moses asked for God’s name in Exodus 3, it was describing an aspect of what He was. I AM describes His eternal nature. Always existing. YHVH carries the same meaning as His covenant name with Israel as the “Becoming One.” Exodus 34 is following Israel’s violation of their promise to God not to worship any other false gods and turning to the Golden Calf. He reminded them there would be consequences since he called them to a covenant relationship with Him. He was jealous like a husband is for his wife. He’s not keen on “sharing” those that have committed themselves to Him for life. Ignoring cultural context of names is not a contradiction.  
49. Will the Messiah be a descendant of David?
2 Samuel 7:12-13: Yes - Mark 12:35-37: No
Answer: Jesus is asking a rhetorical question to the Pharisees in Mark who refused to answer His question. He asked how David’s son could be his Lord since honor in that culture always went to the older male in the home. Patriarchy. The only way David’s son could also be his Lord is also found in Psalm 2  that he is quoting. His biological offspring promised in 2 Samuel 7:12-13, which the atheist allowed as a valid claim that the Messiah would be, would be God Himself. The Lord of King David. Ignoring Jesus’ point and reading the text woodenly without context isn’t a contradiction.
50. Did Jesus go to Heaven after He died or when He ascended?
Luke 23:42-43: When He died. - John 20:17: After His ascension.
Answer: John 20:17 describes His physical body ascending into Heaven. This happened after His soul returned to His body and glorified it. Luke 23 is talking about what happens to everyone who dies in Christianity. Their souls go to God’s presence. Since Jesus was God and the man on the cross He was speaking to was also going to physically die, he was going to be with Him as Jesus returned to be with the Father spiritually. His body stayed on Earth for 3 days before rising with His soul returned to it. Ignoring the definition of Heaven, the context of Jesus’ statement to the man on the cross, and falsely comparing a physical ascension as incompatible with your spirit going to Heaven are not contradictions.   


##### Sources/Evidence: Plainly reading the biblical text quoted as “contradictions.”
##### Verses: Provided in each false claim.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Jesus Didn't Bodily Ressurect</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. This claim is based on Naturalism. The belief that all things can be explained and occur in a way that pertain to the 5 senses. Touch, Sight, Taste, Smell, and Hear. This worldview is fundamentally incoherent since things like the Laws of Logic aren’t physical in any way, and yet are required to be real in order for it to be true. The belief’s assumption cancels itself out. 
2. Saying Jesus didn’t rise from the dead is a historical claim, which requires historical evidence to disprove. The only claims against Jesus’ resurrection are assumptions that reject the possibility of the afterlife. “If people who die have always stayed dead, then there can’t be any exception,”  is hilariously unscientific. “If the law of gravity makes everything on earth fall at -9.8 meters per second, then anyone who has ever held anything up is lying,” ignores the little detail that other factors could be introduced. Like a hand or something. If I make assumptions that I can’t be consistent with anywhere else, they are bad assumptions. 

### Facts: 
In order to prove Jesus rose from the dead, we only need to prove 2 things. 1. Jesus was dead. And 2. Jesus was alive again after His death.
 
Jesus’ death is more documented than the existence of most Roman Emperors and by people who were all alive to see it for themselves or knew the eyewitnesses themselves. Ignoring the 4 gospels, we have followers of Jesus’ original disciples like Polycarp (Disciple of John), Ignatius, and Clement of Rome (Disciples of Peter) who cited the crucifixion of Jesus exactly as it was reported in the gospels. Likewise, there are non-Christian historians and scholars, both ancient and modern, who acknowledge Jesus’ death as one of the most certain facts of ancient history.

1. Thallus (Samaritan) – Reported that Jerusalem went dark during Jesus' execution.
-(Confirmed by Julius Africanus in History volume 3)
2. Tacitus (Roman) – Reported Jesus was executed as a criminal during the reign of Emperor Tiberius.
-(Annals; Book 15, Chapter 44)
3. Talmud (Pharisees) – Reported Jesus was executed by the Romans.
-(Talmud Sanhedrin, 67a)
4. Josephus (Jew) – Reported Jesus was executed during the governorship of Pontius Pilate.
-(Antiquities, XVIII, III)

#### Modern Day:
5. James Dunn (Atheist) - the crucifixion is of the “two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent”
6. John Crossan (Atheist) - “Jesus’ death by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate is as sure as anything historical can ever be.”
7. Bart Ehrman (Atheist) - “The crucifixion of Jesus by the Romans is one of the most secure facts we have about his life”
To Prove Jesus’ Resurrection then requires the same standards applied to His death. According to ancient historical criticism, only two separate sources are required to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt that is over 1000 years old. To demand otherwise is simply unreasonable. And likewise, the more sources you have that are hostile towards your position only prove it more since they wouldn’t admit something was true that they hated. We can prove Jesus rose based on the hostile witnesses alone;

#### Hostile Reports:
1. Saul of Tarsus: A Pharisee who hunted down and killed Christians admitting to meeting Him risen near Damascus.
2. James bin Joseph: Jesus' biological brother thought He was crazy and didn't believe him until after he saw Him risen.
 

#### Positive Reports:
Christian Eyewitnesses: Mary, Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Salome, and other women, Peter, James, John, Thomas, the surviving Apostles together, Over 500 disciples at once including the apostles. (Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20, Acts 1)
1 Corinthians 15:3-8: For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.
These witnesses are important to note because they in themselves are also embarrassing.

#### Christian Reports:
1. The Women: The first eyewitnesses to Jesus' resurrection were women. Culturally, that wouldn't have been made up unless it was true.
2. The Apostles: The followers of Jesus who abandoned Him when He was arrested all saw Him after His death.
3. The Disciples: The followers of Jesus, and of His apostles later on, all affirmed what the Gospels report.

#### Historical Facts:
1. Individuals and groups claimed to encounter Jesus after He was crucified.
2. Friends and Foes of Jesus claimed to encounter Him after He was crucified.
3. These witnesses all endured lives of persecution, torture, and death for sharing this with people.
2 Corinthians 11:24-27: From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness—

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Science Disproves the Bible</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. “Science doesn’t say anything. Scientists do.” -Frank Turek
2. There’s a difference between Ontology, how things are, and Epistemology, where things came from. Science observes, tests, and repeats modern phenomena to prove Ontology. Saying that because things work a certain way today is the same way it always has or how it worked when everything first came into being are very shaky assumptions that have nothing to do with science.
3. “Nonsense from the mouths of geniuses is still nonsense.” -John Lennox 
Facts: 1. Not a single scientific claim discredits a properly understood biblical text. (See Contradictions)
2. Having a college degree doesn’t make you incapable of being wrong.
3. If Jesus claimed to be the God that created the universe, and rose from the dead to prove it, I’m more willing to trust His word on how it happened.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">There is too much Evil for there to be a Good God</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. In order for there to be such a thing as evil, there needs to be an objective standard for what good is and isn’t. If there is no God, you’ve either eliminated the concept of good entirely, or reduced it to an opinion at best.
2. “There can’t be a good God and suffering. If He was all good, He’d want to do something about suffering. If He was all powerful, He’d be capable of doing something about suffering. If He’s not willing then why call Him good? If He’s not able, then why call Him God?” This objection wasn’t originally from Antony Flew. It was brought up historically by Epicurius, who was a hedonist. His view of god was pleasure. This is how his argument sounds when you realize what he means by god. “There is a god I made up whose only concern is to make us feel good all the time and avoid suffering. This god isn’t doing what I decided it should do. This god I made up doesn’t exist.” 
3. Usually the complaint is made asking why God doesn’t punish evil. The person who argues like this has made 3 mistakes. They admitted God exists. They think that they know better than God, who knows everything, concerning when the right time is to punish evil and how. And that God somehow doesn’t have the right to offer mercy. 


### Facts: 
1. The Existence of Morality is an argument for God’s existence. Until a tangible paragon of moral virtue is provided that applies to all people at all times in all places, we can’t explain why we universally have a sense of right and wrong. Unless there is a standard above and beyond this Universe whose authority determined that standard by making us in His own Image. We call this standard God.
2. God will hold everyone accountable for how they used or abused the free will He gave them.
3. God didn’t exempt Himself from our suffering. He was the only one with the right to, yet voluntarily became a part of it. In fact, He suffered more than anyone in existence ever has or will.

### Problems: 
1. Never judge a religion based on its abusers.
2. Not liking the behavior of someone doesn’t make what they say false. If a person who is known to lie tells the truth, it’s still true. If an honest person lies, it’s still a lie.  


### Facts: 
Jesus didn’t discriminate against people. People who do so in His name are doing so ignorant of His teachings and example. I.E. Not Christians.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Christianity is just as Violent as any Other Religion</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. You’re forming conclusions about an entire belief based on the actions of individuals. You wouldn’t call all Muslims terrorists because members of it practice terrorism. You have to go to the source material that inspired them and the historical example of their founder to form effective conclusions about the religion being violent or not.
2. Just because something is violent doesn’t make it false. World History is violent. It doesn’t mean World Wars 1 and 2 weren’t real historical events. You have to ask why the violence took place and form conclusions as to whether or not it was just. The presence of violence doesn’t prove or disprove anything.
3. An Ad Hoc Fallacy is when you dismiss what someone says by claiming they do what you are being accused of. It doesn’t change the fact that you have still done the bad things, and now shows the only way you can defend yourself is by changing the topic. Meaning you don’t have a good defense.

### Facts: 
Every single claim of violence in the Old Testament had a historical context of war after 400+ years of mercy and only directed towards specific cultures that were aware that what they were doing would warrant consequences.
1. Canaan: Warning given by Abraham around 2000BC. Joshua didn’t enter Canaan until 1410BC.
2. Amalek: Warning given by Moses in 1450BC. Saul didn’t get the order to wipe them out until 1000BC.
3. Philistines: Warning given by Samuel in 1100BC. Nebuchadnezzar didn’t wipe them out until 600BC.
4. Assyria: Warning given by Nahum in 700BC. Nebuchadnezzar didn’t take them over until 600BC.
5. Babylon: Warning given by Micah/Isaiah in 700BC. The Persians didn’t take them over until the 500’s. 

#### Sources/Evidence: 
Ad Hoc Fallacy defined above. 
 
Verses-Warnings:

+ Abraham: Genesis 15:15-31
+ Moses: Exodus 17:16
+ Samuel: 1 Samuel 5-7

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">It's Arrogant for Christians to Claim they have the Truth</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. That’s how truth works. There’s one law of gravity that applies to all people at all times in all places. If Christianity is true, then by definition all other beliefs that conflict with its claims are false.
2. To say that there is no absolute truth is a self-defeating statement. “There is no absolute truth! Is that absolutely true?” 
3. Christianity and other world religions (including atheism) make claims that all exclude each other. They can all be wrong, or one of them can be right, but they all can’t be right.
 
### Facts:
Christianity claims to be true. That is either true or it isn’t. Its truth claims are impossible to reconcile with other opposing beliefs.

**_Islam_**: Claims Jesus wasn’t God nor was crucified in Surah 4 of the Quran. The Bible teaches opposite.

**_Buddhism_**: Claims the Universe is eternal and the impersonal god who we become one with through reincarnation. The Bible teaches a personal God separate from His creation and that salvation is decided in one lifetime.

**_Atheism_**: Claims there is no God. The Bible teaches there is.

**_Naturalism_**: Claims there is nothing that can’t be observed with the 5 senses. The Bible teaches there are non-physical things that are just as real as we are. (Examples: Logic, Math, God, Angels, Souls)

**_Paganism_**: Claims there are many gods/goddesses. The Bible teaches there is only one.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">There should be separation of Church and State (America)</h1> 

### Problems: 
1. What do you mean by separation? That one shouldn’t be allowed in the other, involved in the other, or allowed to influence the other? Refusing someone’s right to practice a religion doesn’t sound like freedom. Refusing someone the right to run for office because they believe in different things than you sounds like a dictatorship. Refusing to allow the government to order a population what religion they are to practice is the purpose Thomas Jefferson brought it up. Words matter. What do you mean by them?
  
### Facts: 
1. The original proposal in 1791 by Thomas Jefferson was a clarification on the 1st Amendment which guarantees the freedom of speech and religion to every citizen of the United States so there wouldn’t be a state mandated religion like Europe.
2. The first amendment does not restrict the actions of those with religious views so long as their religious practices do not violate the law. (Example: Jihad through Terrorism is illegal. Not for religious reasons, but because mass murder is a capital offense)

### Problems: 
1. There isn’t even 1,000 Christian denominations. 
2. A worldview having a wide diversity of application only means there is a wide diversity of appliers. 
3. A group down the street calling themselves Christian doesn’t make them a denomination.
4. There are things you have to be in order to be considered a Christian for the same reason there are things you have to believe in order to be a Buddhist or Muslim.
  
### Facts: 
1. Not a single Christian denomination differs in the core claims of Christianity. They all acknowledge the Deity of Christ, The nature of the Trinity, the process of Salvation, and the Authority of Scripture.
2. The differences between the denominations are in how they observe the same truths they share with the other Christian groups. Differences in preferred approaches to conduct in church and worship practices don’t make you an entirely different religion.

### Problems: 
1. Expecting the Creator to function the same way as His Creation is unreasonable.
2. Expecting the Designer to follow His own designs is irrational.
3. Demanding God follow the same rules that humans do is stupid.

### Facts: 
1. God is spiritual, not material. Though He has a consciousness, He doesn’t have a material body and thus shouldn’t be expected to act like one.
 
#### Sources/Evidence: 
The Kalam Cosmological Argument: Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The Universe began to exist, therefore the Universe had a cause. This cause was bigger than the Universe, smart enough to cause a functional universe capable of supporting life and not collapse in on itself, conscious enough to want to create a universe, existed before the beginning of the Universe (time itself), and existed before the creation of matter. (Immaterial) What do you call a living and conscious being who is more powerful than anything that exists, has always existed, and is Spirit rather than made of matter? God.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">The Council of Nicaea Invented Modern Christianity</h1>

### Problems: 
1. Atheist and Agnostic scholars both acknowledge that Jesus’ deity, death, and resurrection were all established as authoritative tradition within MONTHS of His crucifixion. Not 300 years later.
2. The Council of Nicaea had nothing to do with the Canon. It was on how Jesus was both God and man.
3. The Davinci Code is a self-admitted work of fiction and not a sound historical reference.

### Facts: 
1. The Council of Nicaea was one of the first public meetings of Christians that was sponsored by the Emperor and without the risk of being murdered for their faith. It was dealing with the teachings of a bishop named Arius who held an abhorrent view of Jesus as only a man but not God due to his cultural biases. They didn’t bring up anything but the Bible to dispute his points and left the council with nothing added to Christianity that wasn’t already there since the first Easter. 

#### Sources/Evidence: 
1. “This tradition, we can be entirely confident, was formulated as tradition within months of Jesus’ death.” -James DG Dunn from the Jesus Seminar referring to 1 Corinthians 15:3-7
2. “Paul ‘received’ the tradition-that is, he was taught it at his conversion-perhaps two years after Jesus’ death.” -Michael Goulder from the Jesus Seminar
3. “[The Creed in 1 Corinthians 15:3-8] indubitably goes back to the oldest phase of all in the history of primitive Christianity.” -Ulrich Wilckens
4. “The elements in the tradition are to be dated to the first two years after the crucifixion of Jesus.” -Gerd Ludemann
5. “Within two or three years of the first Easter.” -Paul Barnett
6. “From only a few years after Jesus’ death.” -Richard Burridge and Graham Gould

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Jesus' Legend Was Borrowed From Other Ancient Religions</h1>

### Problems: 
1. Apart from the fact that gods in pagan myths also performed miracles, which is incredibly vague, the overwhelming majority of claims that ancient pagan myths that are identical to the Gospels are simply false claims.
2. Every single source that bears closer resemblances to Christianity were dated centuries after Christianity was well known throughout the Roman Empire. The Evidence shows the copying was made by the pagans, not the Christians.
3. To claim Jesus was a legend like pagan myths in the past is a horrible comparison to make. The names of the original authors are cited from the eyewitnesses and their followers at verifiable moment in history that can be tested or disproven. Mythological deities or Eastern religious figures don’t give us dates or any archeological support for anything they say. It’s a dishonest or uninformed comparison to make.


### Facts: 
1. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Horus is factually false: 
-Baptized at 30 by Anup the Baptizer? 
That isn’t anywhere in the Egyptian sources, along with “El-Azur-us” being raised by him. 
-Visited by 3 wise men? 
That is false. Horus wasn’t visited by 3 wise men and neither was Jesus. He was visited by an undisclosed number of magi from the Parthian Empire with 3 gifts after Daniel’s prophecies clued them in on his scriptures during his time with them and were guided by a moving light, not a star.
-Born of a Virgin? 
Isis wasn’t a virgin. She turned into a bird and had sex with the corpse of Osiris. 
-Born on December 25th? 
Neither the Egyptian book of the dead or the Bible claim that.
-Had 12 Disciples? 
That is false. There is only one hieroglyph of Horus surrounded by the Zodiac. Jesus had 12 Apostles and Hundreds of Disciples.
-Performed Miracles? 
All pagan gods did that. A little generic to claim a rip off. That’s like claiming Marvel ripped off DC because both of their heroes have super powers.
-Crucified, Buried in a Tomb, and Rose from the Dead? 
Horus died by being torn to pieces and scattered throughout the Nile. His mom put him back together and brought him to the underworld. Crucifixion wasn’t invented until 500BC by the Assyrians, which is over 1000 years after Horus’ myth was completed.

2. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Krishna is factually false: 
-Taught through parables? That isn’t true. He taught things about Hinduism, but not through parables.
-His beloved disciple Arunja means John? Ask anyone who speaks the language. That is false.
-Was killed at 30 and rose from the dead? He was killed at 125 with an arrow by a hunter named Jara by accident. He then returned to the place of the Hindu gods.
-Was crucified on a tree between two thieves? Crucifixion wasn’t invented during Krishna’s lifetime. He was killed by an arrow on accident.
-Was the Lion of the Tribe of Saki? That is false. Not a single Hindu source says that. 
-Born of a Virgin? His mother Devaki had 7 other sons before he was born. He was born without sexual intercourse, but his mother wasn’t a virgin.
-Called the second person of the Hindu Trimurti? That is false. He was one of the 10 Avatars of Vishnu, who is a separate god from Shiva and Brahma. Not a single God with 3 centers of consciousness.

3. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Zoroaster is factually false: 
-Born of a Virgin? 
Zoroaster’s mother was married and had children before Zoroaster was born. 
-Baptised in a River? Zoroaster received his revelations about Ahriman and Aru Mazda by a river. He wasn’t dedicated to God in a Jewish ceremony of purification.
-Was tempted in the wilderness by the devil for 40 days? 
Zoroaster was attacked by Buiti for 10 years, not 40 days. And Buiti wasn’t the head demon Ahriman. He was a lesser spirit. And he didn’t face him in the wilderness.
-Cast out demons and healed a blind man? 
There is no mention of Zoroaster having any power over demons, and the only mention of him performing a miracle like Jesus did was in Shahrastani of Khorassan, written 1000 years after Jesus’ gospels were made available throughout the known world.
-Referred to as the Word made Flesh and taught Communion through a Cup and Eucharist? 
False.
-Taught about Heaven, Hell, Judgment, and Salvation? 
A little generic don’t you think? And the meanings of those terms were the opposite of Jesus’. God alone would judge, not a committee. Salvation in Zoroastrianism is through works alone. And Heaven and Hell alternate in power over this world every 4000 years in Zoroastrianism.

4. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Mithra is factually false: 
-Born of a Virgin? 
If you mean a rock, then yes. The rock was not a woman who had not had sexual intercourse before.
-Was a Travelling Teacher who Performed Miracles? 
He didn’t travel or teach and all pagan gods performed miracles. 
-Had 12 disciples? 
False. He had 1 Companion named Aruna in the Persian version, and in the Roman version, he had 2 named Cautes and Cautopatres.
-Was sacrificed for world peace? 
He killed a sacred bull that was dangerous once and survived.
-His followers were promised Immortality? 
And?
-Was called The Way, The Truth, and the Life? 
No source says anything close to that.
-His sacred day was Sunday? 
And?

5. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Buddha is factually false: (Note: earliest biography on Buddha dates 200 years after Jesus and when Thomas had already shared the gospel in India)
-Was born of the virgin Maya on December 25th? 
Buddha was born on the 8th day of the 4th Lunar month. And Maya isn’t Miryam. His mother was a queen and Buddha was born naturally.
-His birth was announced by a star? 
That is false. He was born into royalty and the King and his advisors celebrated the fact it was a boy/heir.
-He was pronounced ruler of the world? 
A prophecy was made that he’d Either be a great king OR a great spiritual leader. (1000 years after the fact)
-He fed 5000 men from a small basket of cakes? 
That is false. The generic claim that he performed miracles doesn’t equate to him being the inspiration of anyone and anything miraculous after him.
-He abolished idolatry? 
That is false on both accounts. They both taught against it, but didn’t abolish it.
-He died on a cross? 
Crucifixion wasn’t invented yet nor practiced in India. 
-He glowed in front of his followers on a mountain? 
Referring to Enlightenment or a literal glowing? Jesus became like the Sun. Buddha was described as “enlightened.” There are two different kinds of light being described there. 
-His tomb was supernaturally opened and ascended to Nirvana? 
That is false. One source said he opened his coffin to speak before he died, and then closed it himself.
-He was tempted by the demon Mara? 
And? The temptations weren’t parallels of the temptations Israel fell to when they wandered in the wilderness. No temple, no bread, just a bad starvation dream.
-He was of royal lineage? 
And?
-He will return in the End Times to judge the dead? 
No Buddhist source teaches that. The Buddha to return, Maitreya, will be an entirely different person.

6. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Romulus is factually false: 
-Was born from the virgin Rhea? 
Rhea was raped by Mars when she was a virgin. Not a virgin at his birth.
-Was an incarnate god who came to establish a kingdom on this earth? 
That is false. He became a demi-god after he was taken into Heaven, and Plutarch wrote this. He was born in 45AD when Christianity had already spread as far as Asia Minor, and didn’t start recording history or telling these stories until after Christianity’s influence had spread throughout the entire Roman Empire. 105AD vs 40AD? Which came first? The Gospels or Plutarch? Jesus was God before He was born (John 1:1-12, Philippians 2:3-11) and remained so after His ascension into Heaven. Romulus became a partial god after his death. There’s a difference and one source is much later than the other.
-Romulus and Remus were thrown into a river and left for dead, which is the same as the slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem. 
How?
-Was called the Son of God. 
This meant something entirely different for Greeks than it did for Jews. 
Romulus was the biological offspring of a roman god having sex with a mortal woman. Jesus was not conceived by God the Father having sex with Mary. It is describing His relationship with the Father within the Trinity.
-Gave a great commission. 
Not in the same way Jesus did. Romulus ordered to make his kingdom head over the entire world. Jesus told His disciples to make more followers based on what they had seen happen first hand. He even specified before Pilate that though He was a King, His kingdom was not of this world and therefore His followers weren’t going to be a threat.
-There was darkness before his death. 
Referring to bad weather that took him up in a whirlwind, or referring to the Book of Joel when the wrath of God was being poured out on Jesus and the sun supernaturally did not shine? Two very different things. And to add to this, Plutarch and Dionysius’ writings conflict with each other. Claiming that Romulus was killed by his own people.
-Was taken up to Heaven in a whirlwind. 
This isn’t what happened to Jesus. This happened to Elijah, which was already in writing 800 years before Rome existed. Who copied who?
-His corpse went missing after his death. 
And? We’ve already established that not only are the legends of Romulus written after Christianity had been established even by secular dating of the gospels, but that the way Romulus’ corpse was taken to Heaven and Jesus’ bodily resurrection are two very different things.
-Romulus was also known as Quirinius, who belonged to a triad of deities. 
Nimrod using Simiramus, a separate goddess, to give birth to himself isn’t a Trinity. It’s an incarnation at best, but involves two separate gods to make this work. Not a single God with a unique nature. Semiramis and Nimrod weren’t the same deity.
-Appeared to people after his death. 
The instructions he left to make Rome head over the world was written in Livy’s account which claimed he never died. That’s not a resurrection appearance.

7. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Osiris is factually false: 
-Osiris’ birth was announced by the 3 stars in Orion’s belt that pointed to Osiris’ star in the east. Sirius. The New Testament never claims 3 wise men announced Jesus’ birth. There were 3 gifts given by a large group of magi, not stars, from the Parthian Empire. They followed a light source, literally an aster, to Bethlehem and didn’t see it again until it literally stood over the house Mary and Joseph had moved into at least 2 years after His birth. That wasn’t a star that was guiding them.   
-He flesh was eaten ritually to commune with him through wheat cakes. 
Provide one source this is true.
-The 23rd Psalm was copied from Egyptian texts that call Osiris the Good Shepherd. 
Show me the egyptian texts. They don’t exist.
-The Lord’s Prayer was copied from Osiris’ myth that reads, “O Amen, O Amen, who are in Heaven.” Show me where in the myth. It doesn’t exist. The only thing that the two have in common is that Hebrew prayers also end in amen, which means that you agree with what you’re saying is true. Kind of vague to claim Jesus copied the prayer don’t you think?
-He was called the god of the vine. 
That is false. Osiris is shown in hieroglyphics that include grape vines, but no source calls him by this title. Likewise, Jesus didn’t call Himself God of the Vine either. He called Himself the True Vine as an illustration of His life-giving relationship to His disciples like a vine to its grapes.
-He was called the Resurrection and the Life. 
That is false. Osiris goes to the Underworld and doesn’t resurrect. In fact, he’s one of the few Egyptian gods to go to and remain in the Underworld. I.E. Die.
-He was resurrected and served as hope for all humanity. 
That is false. He died and went to the Underworld and became the god of it. That is not the same as dying, bodily rising from the dead, and ascending into Heaven with the promise that all who believe this happened in history for them will do likewise. Osiris’ death only affected Osiris, and he never returned. 

8. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Dionysus is factually false: 
-He was born from a virgin.
According to the Myth, Zeus impregnated a woman as a lightning bolt. Then she was killed by Hera out of jealousy, leaving Dionysus intact. Zeus then sewed the baby onto his thigh until he was able to be naturally born. That is nothing even remotely close to the Biblical account.
-He was a travelling teacher who performed miracles. 
And? A little vague to claim that Jesus is based on his life with that general of a comparison.
-He was placed in a manger. 
That is false.
-He rose from the dead. 
Dionysus, according to the legend, was kidnapped and eaten by Titans after they boiled him to death. Zeus took the leftover heart and made a new body for him. Not only does this report date a full 100 years after Christianity had spread throughout the Roman Empire, it’s not a resurrection from the dead. It’s a resuscitation at best. Reassembly at worst.
-He was crucified on a tree. 
That is false. The only evidence of that was proven to be a forgery made in the 1900’s known as the Orpheus Amulet.
-He had the exact same kind of trial Jesus had before the Sanhedrin and Governor. 
Read the Bacchae. They were nothing alike. Dionysus kept driving women insane, so a king tried to stop him. He went to humiliate the king and escaped. Then sent the women he had control over to murder the king. The only thing that they have in common was that Jesus and Dionysus went willingly to a trial. 
-His followers ritually killed him and ate his body through bread and wine. 
You mean according to the writings of Achilles Tatius who wrote about Dionysus being eaten a full 100 years after Christians had already been practicing communion as demonstrated at the Last Supper in 30AD? Who borrowed from whom? Likewise, the story is that Dionysus was boiled and eaten by Titans, and Zeus restored his body since his heart was still leftover. The followers of Dionysus never reenacted this ritual. 

9. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Serapis is factually false: 
-He was called the Good Shepherd. 
Give one example of him being called that.
-He performed miracles and healings. 
And? A little general don’t you think?
-He was worshipped through lights, bells, and music. 
And?
-He and renditions of Jesus look exactly alike. 
You mean they had beards?
-He was compared to a sacrificial animal. (Bull vs. Lamb) 
I think they’re referring to Apis, who during the time of Alexander the Great was said to have fused with Osiris when they both went to the underworld. Jesus voluntarily died for a purpose. He didn’t fuse with another deity and become Osipris in the Underworld.
-He was yearly sacrificed for the sins of Egypt. 
Where does the Bible say that Jesus dies every year for our sins? According to the books of Hebrews, Numbers, 1 Corinthians, Matthew, Luke, and John, Jesus’ death only took place once to accomplish our ransom back to God. The Egyptians didn’t sacrifice bulls for their sins. They sacrificed them to gain favor with their gods. 
-The Roman Emperor Hadrian called the followers of Serapis Christians. 
The letter written in 134AD, 100 years after Christianity began, by a Roman Emperor capable of getting things confused? Also, this letter was only mentioned in The Historia Augusta in the 300’s, and has been discredited as a volume of forgeries? The letter so full of historical anachronisms that it mentions his adopted son Lucius Varius with him in Egypt despite the fact that he didn’t even know he existed until 20 years later, and describes political representatives Servianus decades before they became consuls? Historians like GW Bowersock say that it is a work of fiction and not historically viable.
 
10. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Inanna/Ishtar is factually false: 
-She was crucified? 
That never appears once in the original myth. The entire myth is that she descends into the underworld, passes through 7 gates that costs her a piece of her jewelry/clothing, then is thrown into prison and suffers with a disease until she’s rescued so people can continue to “worship” her. The only parallel you could make was that her body was hung on a hook. That isn’t anything close to crucifixion. Jesus was physically tortured through crucifixion in order to kill Him. Not to display His dead body.
-She was stripped naked? 
Jesus was stripped naked as a result of Roman torture. Ishtar was stripped naked as a result of losing an article of clothing or jewelry in order to enter the Underworld. Two very different types of “stripping.” 
-She was Resurrected? 
Ishtar was tricked into going to the Underworld in an attempt to sieze its throne and ended up sick, in prison, and hung on a hook like a piece of meat. She was rescued by Tammuz who took her place there in the Sumerian version, but both accounts are the same. She ended up turned into a corpse in the Underworld because of her greed for its throne. Jesus physically died, physically rose, and received a new glorified body as a result of His own power. Not because of a power play or Him needing to be rescued. 
-She was dead for 3 days and nights? 
Nowhere in Ishtar’s myth does it tell us how long she spent in the Underworld while she was dead. The journey to the underworld took 3 days. 
-She descended into hell? 
The Bible doesn’t claim Jesus went to Hell to suffer. The only place very uninformed cult groups go to trying to force this is Ephesians 4:8, where Jesus ransomed those captive to Death before His coming and Resurrection now that their sins have been paid for. The fringe scholars who argue that the Egyptian underworld and the Jewish term Sheol are the same thing simply haven’t done their research.

11. The claim that Jesus was based on the myth of Attis is factually false: 
-Born of the virgin Nana? 
Umm, Zeus let some of his seed fall on a mountain that looked like the goddess Rhea, that became an annoying monster that Dionysus tricked into castrating itself through a prank. The dismembered appendage became a tree and Nana found some of its fruit. It disappeared when she placed it on her lap and she became pregnant. How the actual heck does that parallel with Jesus’ birth in any way whatsoever?
-Was slain for the salvation of mankind? 
That is false.
-His body was represented by bread and eaten? 
Wine and bread were forbidden during Attis’ festivals.
-Was both a divine son and father? 
He was a biological son, but not in the relational sense of Jesus. He wasn’t a part of a unique union with Zeus or his mother. He was simply a biologically born son. Not what the Bible says about Jesus in the slightest.
-Was crucified on Friday, where his blood redeemed the earth? 
Actually the myth states that he died under a tree, not on it. And he doesn’t do so to redeem anyone. He is in love with a nymph and a goddess gets jealous, so she kills her competition. Attis then castrates himself and dies, growing into a tree and flowers as a result. No mention of crucifixion or redemption anywhere.
-Resurrected? 
Attis never comes back to life. The jealous goddess asks Zeus to revive him, but he only keeps his body from rotting. That’s all.
-His tomb was found empty by his followers? 
He didn’t have a tomb. He died and became a tree.
-His followers had a ceremony called taurobolium where they were considered “Born Again?” 
Guess when this started? According to every single scholar on ancient roman myths, after Christianity began to spread and gained more followers than their pagan cult.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Jesus Was a Myth</h1>

### Problems: 
1. Jesus is the most well established figure in ancient history. Confirmed by friends and foes not only in His life, but death as well. It’s hard to die if you were never born.
2. The only scholar who holds this position that isn’t an internet troll is Richard Carrier, who is treated by fellow atheist scholars on the same terms as a Holocaust denier.  
3. If you’re going to consistently apply the same standards about history that you would in dismissing Jesus’ existence as a myth, you’d have to throw out history as a study in its entirety. 
Example: Abraham Lincoln existed. Objections: The sources about Abraham Lincoln are too late since they record his death after his death had already happened. The speeches have similarities to other writings before him and couldn’t possibly be references. It must be proof of borrowing to build up this fake figure in history. All of the people who referenced Abraham Lincoln either were biased since they claimed to be his supporters and can’t be trusted to give an accurate account, or never knew him personally and couldn’t have known anything about him in any significant way. Not to mention modern embellishments of the life of Abraham Lincoln have been made like “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” proving it was all a myth to begin with. It couldn’t possibly be that people writing about his life and intentionally advertising it as fiction hundreds of years after the fact didn’t intend to be taken seriously with that kind of title. That’s simply not true scholarship to attempt to harmonize evidence.

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">The Gospels Are Bad History/Too Late to Be Reliable</h1>

### Problems: 
1. Applying this standard consistently throws out all of ancient history older than 200 years.
 
### Facts: 
1. The Gospels are some of the most well preserved and sourced documents in all of ancient history. Written within the lifetimes of the eyewitnesses, affirmed by their disciples, and verified by critics and archeology alike. 

#### Sources/Evidence: 
Creeds dating to the earliest portions of the Church that affirm the core claims of the Gospels, Multiple first hand eyewitness testimonies confirmed as genuine by martyrdom and torture, 
The Laws of Textual Criticism: Two separate sources are required to confirm or deny any single event in ancient history. (Archeology, Written Sources, Confirmed locations and individuals)
The Law of Myth Development: A minimum of 300 years are required before a genuine myth can form. The first eyewitnesses can debunk the myth. The second generation knew the people who saw the events and whether or not they actually happened. The third generation trusts those who came before them. Only after those three generations have died off can lies or embellishments be allowed to flourish in public conversation.
