<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">The Bible Has Been Changed Throughout History</h1></p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Problems</h3>

<ol>
<li>Define what you mean by “Changed.” Languages change over time to adapt to culture and the meanings remain the same. If a message changes grammatically, the content can still be preserved. If something is changed doctrinally, it isn’t the same message you started with. This kind of change simply can’t be found in the Old or New Testament and we have written evidence to confirm this.</li>
<li>What is your standard for reliable transmission of a message? If your standards throw out all of history as a result, you’re not being reasonable. You’re being a radical skeptic. If no evidence will convince you, you’re not looking for truth. You’re ignoring it.</li>
<li>“The Bible was written by humans. Humans make mistakes. Therefore the Bible is full of mistakes.” is a self-defeating statement. “That statement was written by humans. Humans make mistakes. Therefore, that statement is full of mistakes.” You are assuming too much before looking at the evidence. If you believe there are mistakes, point to them specifically. Don’t just make up a clever saying that ends up destroying itself when you think about it for more than 3 seconds.<br /></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_3">Facts</h3>

<ol>
<li>We have more written evidence to support the New Testament than any other document in ancient history. (Over 1000 years old) The earliest complete copies, the Codex Vaticanus and Sinaiticus are Greek copies of the New Testament that are both dated to the 300’s AD. The closest any ancient writing in history comes as close to the original as the New Testament is Homer’s Illiad, which we found a copy of 500 years after the original was written.</li>
<li>The earliest physical evidence of the Bible’s existence is the John Ryland Fragment P52. It is a piece of The Gospel of John including several verses from chapter 18 and is dated to within 20 years of the original. Within the lifetimes of those who had seen the original and its author.</li>
<li>There are two ways to test if something has been changed over time. Compare the earliest copies to the latest and compare the differences, or Compare all the copies you have and see where and when changes took place over time. The earliest copy of the New Testament is the Vaticanus and it’s identical to what we’re reading today. The total number of New Testament manuscripts we have available to us to compare to the others number over 26,000 the last time we counted. We have more ability to test changes in the Bible than any other written piece of information in ancient history.
Sources/Evidence: John Ryland Fragment P52, The Codex Vaticanus (300AD), The Codex Sinaiticus (450AD), The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ by Dr. Gary Habermas, Christian Apologetics by Norm Geisler, A Ready Defense by Josh McDowell,
Verses: 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 2 Peter 1:16, Isaiah 40:8</li>

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">The Bible Contradicts Itself</h1></p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Problems:</h3>

<ol>
<li>A Difference between two details is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>An addition to detail is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>A scribal error is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Misrepresenting the text and comparing it to another piece is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Reading a passage out of context and comparing it to another is not a contradiction.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_5">Facts:</h3>

<ol>
<li>A Contradiction is where two things in the same way and in the same sense cancel each other out. The First Law of Logic is the law of Non-Contradiction. Two things that cancel each other out can’t both be true in the same way and in the same sense.</li>
<li>Context is the who, what, when, where, why, and how of a statement. There are 3 kinds of Contexts you’ll run into when you read anything; Immediate Context - What happened after and leading up to what was said.</li>
</ol>

<p>Historical Context - When, where, and to whom something was said.
Extended Literary Context - What kind of book and what kind of person wrote the statement.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Examples:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Did the Samaritans receive Jesus or not?
John 4:39-40: Yes - Luke 9:52-53: No
Answer: Read Luke again. This was towards the end of His ministry. John was at the beginning. People’s opinions change over time. That’s not a contradiction. It’s a different time in the same place.</li>
<li>Does the Bible say to honor parents or to dishonor them?
Luke 9:59-62: Don&rsquo;t honor parents (Let the dead bury their own dead). - Exodus 20:12: Honor Parents
Answer: The saying, “Let me bury my father” doesn’t mean his dad died. He was saying that he’ll follow Jesus after his dad dies at some point in the distant future. Not understanding a cultural phrase isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Did Herod think Jesus was John the Baptist?
Matthew 14:1-2/Mark 6:16: Yes - Luke 9:9: No.
Answer: Herod can be wrong about things. He and many others thought that Jesus was John risen from the dead. That wasn’t true. They simply recorded his opinion. All three accounts including Luke’s mention that this is what people thought. Read verses 7-8. Matthew doesn’t mention Herod’s opinion and doesn’t conflict in any way with Luke. Mark summarizes the exact same statements in Luke and Matthew. And Herod in no way denies he thought Jesus could be John. He only says that he beheaded John. If Herod believed John had risen as Matthew and Mark report, then he just acknowledges the first key detail in rising. That he was dead. A difference in phrasing is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Can Anyone cast out demons or only followers of Jesus?
Mark 16:17: Only Jesus&rsquo; Followers - Matthew 7:21-23/Mark 9:38/Luke 9:49: People who weren&rsquo;t following Jesus
Answer: The passage in Mark answers your question. The people who didn’t follow Jesus still believed in Him. They simply weren’t among the group known as His disciples. (followers) All of the miracles they performed they did in Jesus’ name. Misinterpreting a passage isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Are people who aren&rsquo;t with Jesus against Him?
Luke 11:23: Those who are not with Jesus are against Him - Luke 9:50: Those who are not against Jesus are with Him.
Answer: Two different chapters, two different audiences. Those in chapter 11 were the Pharisees who tried explaining away the miracles Jesus performed as the works of Satan. Enemies. Those in chapter 9 were people performing miracles in Jesus’ name and believing in Him even though they weren’t a part of the group known as the disciples. Not Enemies. Ignoring Context isn’t a Contradiction.</li>
<li>Was Jairus&rsquo; daughter dead or alive when he asked Jesus to heal her?
Luke 8:41-42: She was still alive and died along the way. - Matthew 9:18: She was dead and Jairus asked Jesus to raise her.
Answer: Matthew and Luke are two different people noting the same event. The only differences are the additions to detail Luke provides. Matthew remembers Jairus’ daughter died and asked Jesus to raise her. Luke includes the detail that she was sick and asked Jesus to heal her, then when a messenger told him she had died, he asked Jesus to raise her. (Where Matthew’s account starts) An additional detail isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>What was Sodom&rsquo;s sin?
Luke 10:10-12: Inhospitality? - Jude 1:7/Genesis 19:1-5: Sexual immorality? - Jeremiah 23:14: Adultery and Lies?
Answer: Where do any of these exclude the others? Are Sexually Immoral people always Hospitable? Are liars and adulterers always hospitable and sexually moral? Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Was Jesus born in a manger or a house?
Luke 2:1-7: A manger - Matthew 2:11: A house
Answer: Matthew 2 took place at least 2 years after Jesus’ birth. Plenty of time for Joseph to find Mary and Jesus a roof over their heads. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Was Mary blessed?
Luke 1:26-28: Yes. - Luke 11:27-28: No.
Answer: Luke 11 in no way discredits the fact that giving birth to the Messiah is an honor. Jesus didn’t deny her being blessed for that reason in any way. He simply took the time to take a woman’s attention off of His biological mother and back onto the word of God. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>How many demon possessed men were there outside of Gadarine county?
Luke 8:26-27/Mark 5:1-2: One man - Matthew 8:28: Two men
Answer: Luke and Mark don’t say one man and only one man. They focus on that man because he did all the talking. Matthew was a tax collector and noticed numbers. He included that detail that in no way discredits the others. Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Were the Pharisees baptized by John the Baptist?
Matthew 3:7-11: Yes - Luke 7:29-30: No
Answer: Matthew says they came to be baptized. If you read the passage, you’d find out that John refused to baptize them. Luke is consistent with this. Misreading two passages is not a contradiction</li>
<li>Where did the demons ask not to be sent?
Mark 5:9-10: Out of the country. - Luke 8:30-31: To the Abyss.
Answer: Is the Abyss in the country of Judea? It’s not even in this universe. Not knowing what the Abyss is isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Does God lead us into temptation or not?
James 1:13-14: No - Matthew 6:13: Yes
Answer: Read Matthew again. You’re assuming God regularly leads you into temptation as opposed to delivering you from the evil one. Reading half a verse isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Does God sleep?
Psalm 121:3-4: No - Psalm 44:23: Yes
Answer: Both are Psalms, poems using figurative language to illustrate God’s involvement in Israel, and at another time in history, describing how he felt about God’s lack of involvement. Ignoring what kind of book you’re reading and taking them woodenly is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>How did David kill Goliath?
1 Samuel 17:49-50: A sling - 1 Samuel 17:51: Cutting his head off with his own sword.
Answer: You cut a passage in half to ignore the answer to your objection. David knocked Goliath out with a sling, and confirmed his death by cutting off his head. Taking a passage out of context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Do Christians know how to pray?
Matthew 6:9-13: Yes. - Romans 8:26: No.
Answer: Read Romans again. The phrase is “as we ought.” Jesus showed His disciples how to pray, but where we fall short, the Holy Spirit fills in the gaps. Misrepresenting the passages aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Was Moses a good speaker?
Acts 7:22: Yes. - Exodus 4:10: No.
Answer: Moses was a good speaker the first 40 years of his life. After killing the Egyptian, he spent 40 years in the wilderness talking to sheep. At 80 years old, it is possible he wasn’t as good a speaker as he was. Ignoring the context of both statements is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Can thieves go to Heaven?
1 Corinthians 6:9-10: No - Mark 15:27/Luke 23:32;43: Yes
Answer: Read verse 11. The thief recognized Jesus as His Savior and was in the same boat as those Paul describes as “were thieves.” Reading half of a passage out of context isn’t a contradiction.<br /></li>
<li>When was Jesus&rsquo; beaten?
John 19:2-3;16: Before Pilate ordered His crucifixion. - Matthew 27:26/Mark 15:15: After Pilate ordered His crucifixion.
Answer: Do any of those passages say He was beaten only once? Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Was Lot Abraham&rsquo;s brother or nephew?
Genesis 14:14-16: Brother. - Genesis 14:12: Nephew.
Answer: The word in Genesis 14:14 is relative. Achiw in Hebrew. Assuming the literal term brother in the modern sense without doing 2 minutes of further study isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Was Jonah swallowed by a fish or a whale?
Jonah 1:17: Fish - Matthew 12:40: Whale
Answer: Good grief. Sea creature, Large fish. This isn’t a book of marine biology. It describes what happened. Nit-picking genus terms is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Where did Joseph and Mary live before Jesus was born?
Luke 2:1-7: Nazareth - Matthew 2:1-11: They lived in Bethlehem and moved to Nazareth after fleeing their home in Egypt.
Answer: Matthew’s account gives additional details. Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Did Joseph and Mary go to Egypt or Nazareth after Jesus was born?
Matthew 2:14: Egypt and then Nazareth. - Luke 2:39: Just to Nazareth
Answer: Both? Egypt first, then Nazareth. Additional details aren’t contradictions.<br /></li>
<li>Was Jesus the Son of David?
Matthew 1:6: Yes. - Matthew 22:45 - No, Jesus apparently denied that.
Answer: Jesus is asking the pharisees a question they don’t want to answer because the answer proves He’s not only David’s son, but God. Ignoring the context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Who was Jesus&rsquo; grandfather?
Matthew 1:16: Jacob - Luke 3:23: Heli
Answer: People normally have two sets of grandparents because they have two parents. Luke is Mary’s family history. Matthew is Joseph’s family history. Joseph is noted instead of Mary’s name because the traditional record of family history goes from male to male. Ignoring the context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Is it a good thing to be childish?
Luke 18:17: Yes - Ephesians 4:14: No
Answer: Jesus is addressing a child’s view of a relationship as simply knowing they’re loved. Paul addresses the idea of being childishly manipulated as a bad thing. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Did The Father address Jesus directly?
Mark 1:11: Jesus directly. - Matthew 3:17: Those who attended Jesus&rsquo; baptism.
Answer: You can address two different people who are in the same place at the same time. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Would Jesus always be with His disciples?
Matthew 28:20: Yes, until the end of the age. - John 12:8: No, He won&rsquo;t always be with them.
Answer: Jesus wouldn’t be with them physically after He physically died. When He physically leaves the disciples in Matthew, He’ll be with the disciples through the Holy Spirit, which Jesus described in the other 4 chapters of John they didn’t read. Ignoring the context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>When did Satan enter Judas?
Luke 22:3-7: Before the Last Supper - John 13:27: After the Last Supper.
Answer: Read the passages. One says Satan put it into the heart of Judas to betray Him. After the supper, Satan entered Judas to go through with it. Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Who put a robe on Jesus?
Luke 23:11: Herod&rsquo;s Soldiers - Matthew 27:27-28: Pilate&rsquo;s Soldiers
Answer: Both? Herod’s Soldiers put a purple robe on Jesus to mock him. When the Roman soldiers beat Jesus, they put a purple robe on Him. I wonder where they got it? Same robe perhaps? Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>What did the Centurion call Jesus on the cross?
Matthew 27:54: Son of God - Luke 23:47: A Righteous Man
Answer: Is the Son of God not right with God? Could he have said both things? Not knowing what righteous means is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Where were the women standing when Jesus was crucified?
Luke 23:49: At a distance. - John 19:25: Near the cross.
Answer: Could they have gotten closer over time? Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>What did the sign above Jesus&rsquo; head say?
Matthew 27:37: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. - Mark 15:26: King of the Jews. - Luke 23:38: This is the King of the Jews. - John 19:19: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.
Answer: Additional words aren’t contradictions. They are all the same thing with words left out but none conflicting with the other. Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Who buried Jesus?
Matthew 27:57: Joseph of Arimathaea - John 19:38-42: Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus, - Acts 13:27-29: The Jews and their rulers.
Answer: Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus were Jewish rulers. Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>What did Jesus ride into Jerusalem on?
Matthew 21:5-7: A Donkey and her colt. - Luke 19:35: A colt. - John 12:14: A young donkey
Answer: They’re all the same thing. A Donkey and her colt were both there.The colt was the animal ridden upon.  One is mentioned in one case and both in the other. Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Did both thieves revile Jesus?
Matthew 27:44: Both thieves. - Luke 23:39-42: One thief
Answer: They both reviled him, but one eventually changed his mind. Additional details and ignoring context aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Did Judas identify Jesus with a kiss or did Jesus identify Himself?
John 18:3-5: Jesus identified Himself. - Matthew 26:47-49: Judas identified Jesus with a kiss.
Answer: Could both have happened to confirm to the guards that it indeed was Jesus? Additional details aren’t contradictions.</li>
<li>Was Jesus taken to Annas or Caiaphas first?
Matthew 26:57: Caiaphas - John 18:13: Annas
Answer: Annas first. Matthew doesn’t say He went to Ciaphas first. Assuming things out of context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>When was heaven created?
Matthew 25:34: When the Earth was created. - John 14:2: After Jesus ascended.
Answer: John doesn’t say that is when Heaven was created. He was going to prepare a place for them in Heaven when He ascended. Not create Heaven. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Was Keturah Abraham&rsquo;s wife or concubine?
Genesis 25:1: Wife - 1 Chronicles 1:32: Concubine
Answer: Keturah was a concubine until Sarah died. She then became his wife. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Did Sarah have faith that she would conceive?
Hebrews 11:11: Yes - Genesis 18:10-15: No
Answer: Is it laughing to doubt? Even if you assume she doubted at first, the end result is recorded. She did trust God after He directly addresses her and names her child Laughter. She then reiterates God’s promise to her when she gives birth to the child. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Where does God dwell?
Psalm 9:11: In Zion. - Psalm 123:1: In the Heavens
Answer: What about Psalm 139 where it says God is everywhere? Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>How was Zedekiah related to Nebuchadnezzar?
2 Kings 24:17: His uncle. - 2 Chronicles 36:10: His brother
Answer: The word in 2 Chronicles 36:10 is relative. Achiw in Hebrew. Assuming the literal term brother in the modern sense without doing 2 minutes of further study isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Is God warlike or peaceful?
Exodus 15:3: Warrior - Romans 15:33: Peaceful
Answer: The God of Peace isn’t capable of going to war? Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Who were Saul&rsquo;s sons?
1 Samuel 14:49: One list, - 1 Chronicles 8:33: Different list
Answer: The lists are the same. One includes a contemporary nickname and another son that died and didn’t do anything in history. Ignoring context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Who carried Jesus&rsquo; cross?
John 19:17: Jesus. - Luke 23:26: Simon of Cyrene
Answer: Both? Jesus carried it part of the way, and Simon was compelled to do it the rest of the way after Jesus’ trauma and bloodloss from the Romans scourging got the best of Him. Ignoring context is not a contradiction.</li>
<li>Did Zedekiah&rsquo;s eyes behold the King of Babylon?
Jeremiah 34:3: Yes. - 2 Kings 25:7: No
Answer: 2 Kings 25 and verse 7 says that his eyes were put out and he was taken to Babylon. Verse 6 says he was brought before the king of Babylon who then put his eyes out after seeing him. Ignoring the previous verse isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>What is God&rsquo;s name?
Exodus 6:2-3: YHVH - Exodus 34:14: Jealous - Exodus 3:14: I AM
Answer: Names carry meaning. In American/modern culture, people only have one name and it means little more than what their parents liked or honoring a relative. When Moses asked for God’s name in Exodus 3, it was describing an aspect of what He was. I AM describes His eternal nature. Always existing. YHVH carries the same meaning as His covenant name with Israel as the “Becoming One.” Exodus 34 is following Israel’s violation of their promise to God not to worship any other false gods and turning to the Golden Calf. He reminded them there would be consequences since he called them to a covenant relationship with Him. He was jealous like a husband is for his wife. He’s not keen on “sharing” those that have committed themselves to Him for life. Ignoring cultural context of names is not a contradiction.<br /></li>
<li>Will the Messiah be a descendant of David?
2 Samuel 7:12-13: Yes - Mark 12:35-37: No
Answer: Jesus is asking a rhetorical question to the Pharisees in Mark who refused to answer His question. He asked how David’s son could be his Lord since honor in that culture always went to the older male in the home. Patriarchy. The only way David’s son could also be his Lord is also found in Psalm 2  that he is quoting. His biological offspring promised in 2 Samuel 7:12-13, which the atheist allowed as a valid claim that the Messiah would be, would be God Himself. The Lord of King David. Ignoring Jesus’ point and reading the text woodenly without context isn’t a contradiction.</li>
<li>Did Jesus go to Heaven after He died or when He ascended?
Luke 23:42-43: When He died. - John 20:17: After His ascension.
Answer: John 20:17 describes His physical body ascending into Heaven. This happened after His soul returned to His body and glorified it. Luke 23 is talking about what happens to everyone who dies in Christianity. Their souls go to God’s presence. Since Jesus was God and the man on the cross He was speaking to was also going to physically die, he was going to be with Him as Jesus returned to be with the Father spiritually. His body stayed on Earth for 3 days before rising with His soul returned to it. Ignoring the definition of Heaven, the context of Jesus’ statement to the man on the cross, and falsely comparing a physical ascension as incompatible with your spirit going to Heaven are not contradictions.<br /></li>

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Jesus Didn&rsquo;t Bodily Ressurect</h1></p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Problems:</h3>

<ol>
<li>This claim is based on Naturalism. The belief that all things can be explained and occur in a way that pertain to the 5 senses. Touch, Sight, Taste, Smell, and Hear. This worldview is fundamentally incoherent since things like the Laws of Logic aren’t physical in any way, and yet are required to be real in order for it to be true. The belief’s assumption cancels itself out.</li>
<li>Saying Jesus didn’t rise from the dead is a historical claim, which requires historical evidence to disprove. The only claims against Jesus’ resurrection are assumptions that reject the possibility of the afterlife. “If people who die have always stayed dead, then there can’t be any exception,”  is hilariously unscientific. “If the law of gravity makes everything on earth fall at -9.8 meters per second, then anyone who has ever held anything up is lying,” ignores the little detail that other factors could be introduced. Like a hand or something. If I make assumptions that I can’t be consistent with anywhere else, they are bad assumptions.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_10">Facts:</h3>

<p>In order to prove Jesus rose from the dead, we only need to prove 2 things. 1. Jesus was dead. And 2. Jesus was alive again after His death.</p>

<p>Jesus’ death is more documented than the existence of most Roman Emperors and by people who were all alive to see it for themselves or knew the eyewitnesses themselves. Ignoring the 4 gospels, we have followers of Jesus’ original disciples like Polycarp (Disciple of John), Ignatius, and Clement of Rome (Disciples of Peter) who cited the crucifixion of Jesus exactly as it was reported in the gospels. Likewise, there are non-Christian historians and scholars, both ancient and modern, who acknowledge Jesus’ death as one of the most certain facts of ancient history.</p>

<ol>
<li>Thallus (Samaritan) – Reported that Jerusalem went dark during Jesus&rsquo; execution.
-(Confirmed by Julius Africanus in History volume 3)</li>
<li>Tacitus (Roman) – Reported Jesus was executed as a criminal during the reign of Emperor Tiberius.
-(Annals; Book 15, Chapter 44)</li>
<li>Talmud (Pharisees) – Reported Jesus was executed by the Romans.
-(Talmud Sanhedrin, 67a)</li>
<li>Josephus (Jew) – Reported Jesus was executed during the governorship of Pontius Pilate.
-(Antiquities, XVIII, III)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="toc_11">Modern Day:</h4>

<ol>
<li>James Dunn (Atheist) - the crucifixion is of the “two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent”</li>
<li>John Crossan (Atheist) - “Jesus’ death by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate is as sure as anything historical can ever be.”</li>
<li>Bart Ehrman (Atheist) - “The crucifixion of Jesus by the Romans is one of the most secure facts we have about his life”
To Prove Jesus’ Resurrection then requires the same standards applied to His death. According to ancient historical criticism, only two separate sources are required to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt that is over 1000 years old. To demand otherwise is simply unreasonable. And likewise, the more sources you have that are hostile towards your position only prove it more since they wouldn’t admit something was true that they hated. We can prove Jesus rose based on the hostile witnesses alone;</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="toc_12">Hostile Reports:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Saul of Tarsus: A Pharisee who hunted down and killed Christians admitting to meeting Him risen near Damascus.</li>
<li>James bin Joseph: Jesus&rsquo; biological brother thought He was crazy and didn&rsquo;t believe him until after he saw Him risen.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="toc_13">Positive Reports:</h4>

<p>Christian Eyewitnesses: Mary, Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Salome, and other women, Peter, James, John, Thomas, the surviving Apostles together, Over 500 disciples at once including the apostles. (Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20, Acts 1)
1 Corinthians 15:3-8: For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep. After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time.
These witnesses are important to note because they in themselves are also embarrassing.</p>

<li>The Disciples: The followers of Jesus, and of His apostles later on, all affirmed what the Gospels report.</li>

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">There is too much Evil for there to be a Good God</h1></p>

<h3 id="toc_20">Problems:</h3>

<ol>
<li>In order for there to be such a thing as evil, there needs to be an objective standard for what good is and isn’t. If there is no God, you’ve either eliminated the concept of good entirely, or reduced it to an opinion at best.</li>
<li>“There can’t be a good God and suffering. If He was all good, He’d want to do something about suffering. If He was all powerful, He’d be capable of doing something about suffering. If He’s not willing then why call Him good? If He’s not able, then why call Him God?” This objection wasn’t originally from Antony Flew. It was brought up historically by Epicurius, who was a hedonist. His view of god was pleasure. This is how his argument sounds when you realize what he means by god. “There is a god I made up whose only concern is to make us feel good all the time and avoid suffering. This god isn’t doing what I decided it should do. This god I made up doesn’t exist.”</li>
<li>Usually the complaint is made asking why God doesn’t punish evil. The person who argues like this has made 3 mistakes. They admitted God exists. They think that they know better than God, who knows everything, concerning when the right time is to punish evil and how. And that God somehow doesn’t have the right to offer mercy.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_21">Facts:</h3>

<ol>
<li>The Existence of Morality is an argument for God’s existence. Until a tangible paragon of moral virtue is provided that applies to all people at all times in all places, we can’t explain why we universally have a sense of right and wrong. Unless there is a standard above and beyond this Universe whose authority determined that standard by making us in His own Image. We call this standard God.</li>
<li>God will hold everyone accountable for how they used or abused the free will He gave them.</li>
<li>God didn’t exempt Himself from our suffering. He was the only one with the right to, yet voluntarily became a part of it. In fact, He suffered more than anyone in existence ever has or will.</li>

<h1 style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;font-family:Bookman;font-size:6rem;">Christianity is just as Violent as any Other Religion</h1></p>

<h3 id="toc_25">Problems:</h3>

<ol>
<li>You’re forming conclusions about an entire belief based on the actions of individuals. You wouldn’t call all Muslims terrorists because members of it practice terrorism. You have to go to the source material that inspired them and the historical example of their founder to form effective conclusions about the religion being violent or not.</li>
<li>Just because something is violent doesn’t make it false. World History is violent. It doesn’t mean World Wars 1 and 2 weren’t real historical events. You have to ask why the violence took place and form conclusions as to whether or not it was just. The presence of violence doesn’t prove or disprove anything.</li>
<li>An Ad Hoc Fallacy is when you dismiss what someone says by claiming they do what you are being accused of. It doesn’t change the fact that you have still done the bad things, and now shows the only way you can defend yourself is by changing the topic. Meaning you don’t have a good defense.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_26">Facts:</h3>

<p>Every single claim of violence in the Old Testament had a historical context of war after 400+ years of mercy and only directed towards specific cultures that were aware that what they were doing would warrant consequences.
1. Canaan: Warning given by Abraham around 2000BC. Joshua didn’t enter Canaan until 1410BC.
2. Amalek: Warning given by Moses in 1450BC. Saul didn’t get the order to wipe them out until 1000BC.
3. Philistines: Warning given by Samuel in 1100BC. Nebuchadnezzar didn’t wipe them out until 600BC.
4. Assyria: Warning given by Nahum in 700BC. Nebuchadnezzar didn’t take them over until 600BC.

<h3 id="toc_28">Problems:</h3>

<ol>
<li>That’s how truth works. There’s one law of gravity that applies to all people at all times in all places. If Christianity is true, then by definition all other beliefs that conflict with its claims are false.</li>
<li>To say that there is no absolute truth is a self-defeating statement. “There is no absolute truth! Is that absolutely true?”</li>
<li>Christianity and other world religions (including atheism) make claims that all exclude each other. They can all be wrong, or one of them can be right, but they all can’t be right.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_29">Facts:</h3>

<p>Christianity claims to be true. That is either true or it isn’t. Its truth claims are impossible to reconcile with other opposing beliefs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Islam</em></strong>: Claims Jesus wasn’t God nor was crucified in Surah 4 of the Quran. The Bible teaches opposite.</p>

<p><strong><em>Buddhism</em></strong>: Claims the Universe is eternal and the impersonal god who we become one with through reincarnation. The Bible teaches a personal God separate from His creation and that salvation is decided in one lifetime.</p>

<p><strong><em>Atheism</em></strong>: Claims there is no God. The Bible teaches there is.</p>

<p><strong><em>Naturalism</em></strong>: Claims there is nothing that can’t be observed with the 5 senses. The Bible teaches there are non-physical things that are just as real as we are. (Examples: Logic, Math, God, Angels, Souls)</p>

<li>What do you mean by separation? That one shouldn’t be allowed in the other, involved in the other, or allowed to influence the other? Refusing someone’s right to practice a religion doesn’t sound like freedom. Refusing someone the right to run for office because they believe in different things than you sounds like a dictatorship.
